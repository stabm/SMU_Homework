Italy,"Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimstone and dried herb. The palate isn't overly expressive, offering unripened apple, citrus and dried sage alongside brisk acidity.",Vulkà Bianco,87,,Sicily & Sardinia,Etna,Nicosia 2013 Vulkà Bianco  (Etna),White Blend,Nicosia
Portugal,"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.",Avidagos,87,15,Douro,,Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Quinta dos Avidagos
US,"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented.",,87,14,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Rainstorm 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,Rainstorm
US,"Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.",Reserve Late Harvest,87,13,Michigan,Lake Michigan Shore,St. Julian 2013 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore),Riesling,St. Julian
US,"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.",Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block,87,65,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Pinot Noir,Sweet Cheeks
Spain,"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.",Ars In Vitro,87,15,Northern Spain,Navarra,Tandem 2011 Ars In Vitro Tempranillo-Merlot (Navarra),Tempranillo-Merlot,Tandem
Italy,"Here's a bright, informal red that opens with aromas of candied berry, white pepper and savory herb that carry over to the palate. It's balanced with fresh acidity and soft tannins.",Belsito,87,16,Sicily & Sardinia,Vittoria,Terre di Giurfo 2013 Belsito Frappato (Vittoria),Frappato,Terre di Giurfo
France,"This dry and restrained wine offers spice in profusion. Balanced with acidity and a firm texture, it's very much for food.",,87,24,Alsace,Alsace,Trimbach 2012 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),Gewürztraminer,Trimbach
Germany,"Savory dried thyme notes accent sunnier flavors of preserved peach in this brisk, off-dry wine. It's fruity and fresh, with an elegant, sprightly footprint.",Shine,87,12,Rheinhessen,,Heinz Eifel 2013 Shine Gewürztraminer (Rheinhessen),Gewürztraminer,Heinz Eifel
